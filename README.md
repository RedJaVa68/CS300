This project uses BinarySearchTree as a data structure to sort and list Courses.

A BinarySearchTree data structure is chosen between other different structures based
on comparison of complexity. It was chosen because of its capability of sorting at linear
complexity.

Knowing how to analyze complexity on data structure options helps me design an 
efficient project. Now I take this approach in designing programming projects.
